## Install

    git clone git@github.com:leonardodominik801/computing.london.otaku.rip.git code

## Configure

The sg/ directory holds all the subject guides.

The cw/ directory is broken down into folders labeled after the year of the coursework,
which each then contain the courseworks.

The pp/ directory follows a similar structure for the past papers.

Upload the new files to these directories.

## Run

All we need left is the markdown, so you'll have to run:

    python3 make.py > index.md
